Virtual Color Organ
Jack Ox and David Britton

I was drawn to the work of Jack Ox and David Britton, who have been creating an immersive music visualization system since 1998. The immersive music visualization system is called the "Virtual Color Organ". I was drawn to their work because they are continuously building on this system - taking new risks and developing new avenues for audience immersion. Before Ox partnered with Britton to develop the "Virtual Color Organ", she was working on music visualization offline. She took a huge creative risk by bringing her work into the virtual space, which I find extremely admirable. She took another risk by transforming the system from 2D to 3D, adding both a level of depth and an opportunity for further viewer engagement. I find it interesting that the "Virtual Color Organ" adds a level of depth to the music that it visualizes by using a background based on the desert landscapes of California and Arizona. The algorithm, which uses polygons and colors to represent notes, is impressive on its own, but the use of desert landscapes in the background adds another dimension to the piece. It enables the "Virtual Color Organ" to represent compositions as parabolic spirals. Beyond the complexity that the landscapes add to the work, they also allow for further collaboration with other artists. Richard Rodriguez collaborated with Ox and Britton to create the 3D models of landscapes. Users are taken to another world when watching the visualization of compositions in the "Virtual Color Organ". While I was watching the visualization of "Im Januar am Nil" by Clarence Barlow, I felt myself getting deeper and deeper into the desert as the piece went on. Even though I didn't find the music the most pleasant to listen to, I was drawn in by the colors and constantly changing motions that correspond to certain notes and sounds. I find it amazing that a computer algorithm has the capacity to create such an immersive audience epxerience.

R.G.B: 3 Chromatic Studies
Dennis H. Miller

I was drawn to "R.G.B.: 3 Chromatic Studies, created by Dennis H. Miller, because of the way in which it uses something seemingly simple, color, and explores the unique ways it can be used. "R.G.B.: 3 Chromatic Studies", is a 3-part video. Each part, for roughly 2 minutes, explores a single color and a single technique of image production. The first part explores the color red and fluid dynamic techniques; the second part explores the color green and a particle system; the third part explores the color blue and a model the virtually creates vapor and smoke. I find the artists' specific choices in pairing the colors and the image production technqiues interesting. I found that Miller's choices affected what I was thinking about when I was watching the video. For example, the pairing of red and fluid dynamic techniques reminded me of the many different things the color red is associated with. The fluid nature of the red color reminded me of fire but, at the same time, the constant flowing reminded me of blood. I had the same experience with the pairings for green and blue. The green segment of the video was futuristic in a sense, reminding me of the ideas of aliens and outer spece, but it simultaneously reminded me of grass and earth. The blue segment of the video reminded me of water, but the virtual creation of smoke and vapor with the blue color also gave me a sense of air - I would say that it almost reflected the idea of someone breathing in and out. While watching Miller's work, users have the ability to use their imaginations while watching the flows of the colors on the screen. I loved Miller's piece and, even though my mind moved in many different directions throughout it, by the end, I felt incredibly relaxed.
